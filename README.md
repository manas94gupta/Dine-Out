# Dine Out           

## Introduction

Dine Out helps you to find a nearby place to party/dine at or order from. You can
sort the places by 14 different categories and view their location and other info
on google maps.         
Dine Out uses google maps api and zomato api to retrieve the desired restaurants info
from zomato's database and display them on the google maps. The user interface is
responsive and intuitive to use. The map also has a button to switch between dark and
normal mode.                
Users can search for the places in a specific location by entering an address in the
sidebar, and then they can also search among the retrieved places in the sidebar.        
Clicking on a marker on the map opens up an info window with ratings, pictures,
address and other info.
